# Exploring-Datasets
This repository holds all the datasets I'm currently exploring or have explored 
# <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Google App Store Dataset </a> :
Dataset includes two files: 
1) An overview of the applications on Google Play Store. <br/>
2) Individual reviews of applications and it's sentiment(postive/negative).
<br/>
My goal of the dataset is to try to find evidence that proves or disproves if fake reviews outnumber real reviews. At the end of my experiment, I will also recommend what I think could improve the review system on the Google Play Store.

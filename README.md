# Exploring-Datasets
This repository holds all the datasets I'm currently exploring or have explored 
# <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">Google App Store Dataset </a> :
Dataset includes two files: 
1) An overview of the applications on Google Play Store. <br/>
2) Individual reviews of applications and it's sentiment(postive/negative).
<br/>
My goal of the dataset is to try to find evidence that proves or disproves if fake reviews outnumber real reviews. At the end of my experiment, I will also recommend what I think could improve the review system on the Google Play Store. 
<br/> 

# <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results">Olympics Dataset </a> :
Dataset includes two files:
1) The information of every Olympian who has medalled in an event (Name,Nationality,Event,etc.) <br/>
2) The region information 
<br/>
So far, my goal of the dataset is to find what sports/events need early-age exposure and what sports/events don't. An example is Women's Swimming (400 metres Freestyle) where fourteen U14 swimmers have medalled in this event throughout the history of the Olympics.
